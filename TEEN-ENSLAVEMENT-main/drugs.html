        <b><u>Injecting drugs: </u></b>
        <main><br>Injecting drugs is very risky and can lead to long term vein damage or even gangrene and amputation.
When you’re injecting yourself, it’s difficult to make sure it’s done safely. Hands can carry tiny particles of blood that you cannot see and can transfer a virus from one person to another. If the equipment or substance used is not totally clean, you could get an infection in your bloodstream and become very sick. Even the smallest amount of infected blood that gets into your bloodstream could be enough to give you a virus that can make you very seriously ill, like HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C.
There are things that you can do to try and make it safer but you can never be sure that you are not doing harm to yourself.
If you do inject drugs:
<ul>
<li>Use sterile equipment every time</li>
<li>Never share any equipment</li>
<li>Wash your hands and all preparation services.</li>
